Fully 3D printed Connect 4 add-on that sorts the peices for you at the touch of a button.
The solution is maded up of 3 parts which will be broken down below: sensing color, dividing peices, one rwo handling.

Attached is the Fusion 360 so the models can be editted directly and used to better understand how it is brocken down. A youtube link for build process and comedic relief: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tsY3SJziWs&t=1s

# Sensing Color

The IR sensor is able to reflect off of the red peice but not the red peice alwoing for a simple binary approach. This requires that one of the peice colors is black, but this method reduces the number of cables and is the simple solution.
